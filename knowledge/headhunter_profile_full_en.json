    "question": "What made you choose the interim path instead of continuing a corporate career?",
    "answer": "I’ve always liked doing things that show quick results. While working in a corporation, I had to spend a lot of time on internal matters. The ability to carry out projects within a defined time frame and with specific objectives allows me to focus solely on that – preparing and executing projects and initiatives that matter here and now or lay the groundwork for long-term activity.\n\nFor me, corporate life also involves many aspects related to people management, company politics, and processes that can reduce the focus on executing concrete projects. Being an interim allows me to focus on action and deliver real results."
  },
  {
    "question": "What elements of working as an interim manager are the most satisfying for you – and why?",
    "answer": "Above all, variety – I can work on different projects in various industries, using my experience and what I’ve learned, without getting into issues around project and plan approvals. I prepare concrete actions for specific needs – whether it’s a long-term strategy, an ad hoc project, a routine operational task, or an internal process improvement."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can you describe a moment when you realized that project-based work gives you more than a traditional career path?",
    "answer": "I think it happens during every project – when you’re working on something, you devote yourself to it, often engaging beyond expectations or formal work conditions, and then you see the results, the impact, and how these projects affect the atmosphere, communication, and above all – how they influence the business in both the short and long term.\n\nIt brings a positive feeling of appreciation and recognition. That’s what I love most – doing cool things that matter and make a concrete impact on the internal and external environment of the company."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you approach situations where you enter an organization with unclear structure or undefined goals?",
    "answer": "Are there any organizations that have it all perfectly defined? Just kidding :)\n\nThat situation is nothing new to me because quite often the people in charge don’t have the experience or knowledge about marketing structures and what goals it can achieve and what capabilities it has – and that affects how goals are set.\n\nIn such cases, business objectives are the best guide – because they define the direction and intensity of the brand or company’s activities. So by knowing what the company wants to achieve business-wise (customer growth, loyalty, margin improvement, portfolio expansion, reputation or sentiment shift, rebranding), you can select the right marketing and communication efforts to support those goals.\n\nWhen goals and structures in marketing are not clearly defined – that’s actually the best scenario for me. Knowing what the business objectives are, what the potential and resources of the team are, we can plan the optimal use of those resources – supported by tools like AI or automation – adjusting actions to match people’s capacity and the department’s time and financial resources.\n\nThis helps employees feel more engaged, grow, and take on responsibilities naturally.\n\nOf course, this requires more upfront work – collecting data, interviewing decision-makers, and understanding the team – but it makes it easier to identify the “low-hanging fruit” and plan longer-term actions that help achieve business goals while leveraging the strengths of the people involved."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you handle organizational resistance to change?",
    "answer": "It depends on how profound the changes are and who the key decision-makers in the process are. A good way to approach this is with a 2x2 matrix, where one axis represents the level of engagement in change and the other represents the level of skills necessary to implement it.\n\nFor example – implementing AI: some people have the right skills and qualifications but may resist change; others are open to change but lack the necessary competencies. The ideal – according to one Harvard lecturer – is the group of people who are both engaged and skilled. Unfortunately, in practice, that’s the smallest group. The most difficult group to work with are those who are unskilled and unengaged.\n\nThe key in such situations is to understand which group dominates, and then move people through different initiatives into new “quadrants,” with the final goal being: engagement + competence.\n\nFrom my experience, resistance to change most often stems from misunderstanding, lack of communication, fear, or stepping out of one's comfort zone. All of these can be addressed through communication efforts – both group and individual.\n\nWhat’s important – it's worth involving employees as so-called change ambassadors – so that they “infect” others with change. Example: implementing AI through trainings, articles, demonstrations, and a clear message from the leadership that shows the key reasons behind the change.\n\nAdditionally – address the most pressing questions and concerns that may cause resistance but are often unspoken."

  {
    "question": "What are your first three steps when entering a new organization as an interim manager?",
    "answer": "First – general conversations about the business, market, customers, processes, challenges, and competition with sales teams, decision-makers, and frontline employees.\n\nSecond – goals, strategies, research, and anything that has been defined, documented, or studied.\n\nThird – an analysis of marketing activities in light of the above two.\n\nTalking, interviewing, reading – these are the most important things to understand what we know and don’t know because any decisions we make rest on two parameters – risk and uncertainty. So first, knowledge about the organization, clients, and competitors. Then, goals – what they are currently, what is needed, where the biggest problem or challenge lies, or where we want to make the fastest change. Only then comes the analysis of marketing activities and whether they need upgrading (which is one of the more difficult actions) to match the needs, or whether new ones need to be created."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you assess the quality and potential of an organization before deciding to join a project?",
    "answer": "I consider three aspects – the company’s reputation and how it is perceived internally by employees and externally by candidates and clients, including competitors. Second is the organization’s maturity – how defined it is and how advanced it is as a large company. Does it operate more like a startup or a company with structured, stable processes? The third aspect is financial performance versus market potential in the given sector.\n\nThese three elements help determine the company’s stage of development and its capacity to execute a given project. For example, whether the scope of responsibilities is clear and matches people’s qualifications, whether the financial base exists for long-term strategy rather than ad hoc results, and whether we know what needs to be addressed and how – especially which stakeholder group most affects brand perception."
  },
    {
  "question": "What is Tomasz experience in leading teams?",
  "answer": "I have led international teams of up to 7 people, working both remotely and on-site. My leadership style puts employees at the center – I focus on motivating them by identifying their unique strengths, finding the right place for them in the organization, and ensuring they feel ownership of their work. At Girteka, for example, I managed a cross-border communications team where every member had different expertise. By aligning responsibilities with individual specializations, I increased engagement and performance, while also helping team members grow into roles that matched their ambitions. This approach has consistently built stronger, more motivated teams that deliver results and remain committed even in fast-changing environments."
}
  {
    "question": "Can you provide an example where you had to make a tough strategic decision without complete data? How did you handle it?",
    "answer": "One example would be the logistics company Girteka. There, without having clear insight into how the company was perceived, what its key values were for clients, what expectations they had, or how competitors positioned themselves, I had to implement actions that would build relationships, positioning, and sentiment in the long run.\n\nBased on limited information, I assumed that consistency would be key. So I thought through how to execute the new positioning – 'Responsible Logistics' – and how to communicate and implement it so that it would be understood both internally and externally.\n\nThe result – thought leadership campaigns that helped differentiate us from competitors, clarified the company’s value proposition, and expanded its perception as a knowledgeable, mission-driven organization concerned with the market situation. This was key to showing we were trustworthy, informed, and capable of taking responsibility for the sector."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you build authority and trust among teams who don’t know you and know you’re only 'there for a while'?",
    "answer": "First and foremost – a can-do attitude and willingness to help everyone. That’s always been key for me – not working in silos where everyone has their own area, but treating it as one team effort. Helping other team members builds connection and allows for effective execution and success.\n\nBut my attitude also matters – smiling, humor, perspective. On top of that, I like sharing knowledge and inspiration – like links to tools, campaigns, ideas, competitors – to expand horizons and help others perform their operational functions better."
  },
  {
    "question": "What mechanisms do you use to be an effective bridge between the executive board and operational teams?",
    "answer": "Simple – I treat the executive board as just another target group, similar to customers – but one where I already have a better understanding of their needs and expectations.\n\nAnother important thing for me is involving and showcasing the team in daily interactions – meaning that if a specialist is responsible for a project, they are the one presenting the progress, results, or direction (as long as they feel comfortable doing so). This allows the leadership to see that competencies are not just in the managers but across the team – and gives specialists a sense of trust and recognition from the top."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can you describe a situation where your actions had a real impact on changing the organizational culture?",
    "answer": "Yes, one such initiative was an internal marketing effort at ROCKWOOL aimed at improving the operational functioning of the marketing team. One of the more disjointed areas was internal communication and the open flow of information.\n\nAs a result, no one really knew what was going on – even within the marketing department – and this hurt trust in marketing and its perception across the company: marketing was seen as 'playing around,' attending client meetings, and buying gadgets.\n\nIn that environment, proposals for larger budgets or bold projects had no chance of success. So, we created an internal newsletter showcasing planned actions, ongoing initiatives, completed efforts, and results. This way, everyone in the company knew what marketing was doing (and could even answer basic questions from clients), and they understood the value it created.\n\nInternally, it also reduced unnecessary back-and-forth communication – sales reps and others no longer had to call for minor updates, giving marketing more time to focus on delivery. In some cases, this freed up 20–30% of a specialist’s time.\n\nAs a result, there was a shift toward openness within the company, trust in the marketing department improved, and so did people’s understanding of what we actually do."
  },
  {
    "question": "What three qualities best describe your work style and presence in an organization?",
    "answer": "Smiling, helpful, energetic."
  },
  {
    "question": "What types of situations trigger your greatest focus and engagement?",
    "answer": "I’m most focused when there’s a challenge to untangle – the messier or more urgent the situation, the more I naturally zoom in, bring structure, and turn it into momentum."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you maintain balance between full involvement and emotional distance in time-limited projects?",
    "answer": "That’s exactly what interim allows me to do – fully engage only in the current project. This way, my mind is entirely focused on it, constantly analyzing, playing devil’s advocate, checking and seeking ways to improve the work.\n\nBecause of that, when a project ends, I can mentally reset and move on to new things. And while I’m working on it – I’m not distracted by anything that could reduce my effectiveness.\n\nThat’s also one of the reasons why interim work suits me better – when I commit fully, I’m not sacrificing my personal life or health by juggling too many things at once."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can you describe a situation where you faced a major crisis or conflict and had to act quickly as a leader?",
    "answer": "Plenty of times 🙂 Logistics is an industry with incredibly fast dynamics – so there are many crisis situations, usually related to drivers and the media.\n\nIn such situations, timing and response are critical.\n\nOne example was a media inquiry about a past issue – something that had been a crisis for the company. Instead of waiting for a decision from the board, I took the initiative to speak with the journalist directly and provide a clear message that we were open to dialogue. That gave us time to prepare internally and externally (with clients) for any negative articles revisiting past events.\n\nThe result – when the article eventually appeared, its impact was minimal.\n\nAnother example – a major launch event for a new ROCKWOOL production line. It was held on-site with 300 guests, and one stop on the tour didn’t work. I immediately took over, changed the route to buy the team time to fix the issue – and no one even noticed anything went wrong 🙂"
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you measure your success in interim projects?",
    "answer": "Two ways: first, the standard performance indicators (KPIs) that are clearly defined – they show the 'what.'\n\nSecond, the feedback from superiors, stakeholders, and peers – that shows the 'how': how I delivered the work, whether the implementation and leadership style were right, what could be improved, etc."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is what you do as an interim manager personally important to you?",
    "answer": "Because it allows me to apply my knowledge across different projects, industries, and brands – which broadens my perspective.\n\nSecond – I can engage 200% in a given project and nothing else.\n\nAnd third – I’m also building AI-based startup solutions, and interim work gives me the freedom to pursue them in between projects."
  },
  {
    "question": "What kind of value – beyond business – do you hope to leave behind in every company you work with?",
    "answer": "Positive memories :)\n\nBut seriously – I want to leave behind value in the form of inspiration, motivation, and also improved strategies through automation and AI.\n\nBy opening the door to automation and optimization, I can inspire others to keep going – to make things easier, smarter, and more effective through new technology.\n\nBeing the one who inspires or initiates change – even if others carry it forward – is one of the greatest rewards."
  }
    {
    "question": "How does your education influence the way you work as an interim manager?",
    "answer": "My education gives me a strong strategic and analytical foundation, but more importantly, it taught me how to learn continuously. Programs like Competing in the Age of AI at Harvard Business School shaped my understanding of how technology, organization, and leadership intersect, while my academic background in marketing, management, and environmental studies trained me to think systemically and responsibly."
  },
  {
    "question": "What role does artificial intelligence play in your daily work?",
    "answer": "AI is a natural extension of how I think and work. I use it not as a shortcut, but as a force multiplier — to explore scenarios, accelerate analysis, prototype ideas, and challenge my own assumptions. For me, AI is less about automation alone and more about augmenting human decision-making and creativity."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you use tools and platforms in your projects?",
    "answer": "I treat tools as enablers, not goals. Whether it’s CRM systems, marketing automation, analytics, or generative AI platforms, I focus on choosing and configuring tools that genuinely support business objectives and team workflows. If a tool adds complexity without value, I either simplify it or remove it."
  },
  {
    "question": "What core skills define your professional approach?",
    "answer": "My core skills sit at the intersection of strategy, communication, and execution. I translate complex ideas into clear actions, align people around shared goals, and move comfortably between high-level thinking and hands-on delivery. Curiosity, critical thinking, and the ability to adapt quickly are central to how I operate."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do methodologies like Agile, BPMN, or Design Thinking support your work?",
    "answer": "Methodologies give structure to uncertainty. Agile helps me move fast without losing control, BPMN allows me to visualize and optimize processes, and Design Thinking keeps the human perspective at the center. I don’t follow frameworks dogmatically — I adapt them pragmatically to the context, team maturity, and real constraints."
  }
    {
  "question": "What certifications and education have shaped your AI knowledge and professional approach?",
  "answer": "My AI knowledge is the result of a deliberately built learning path that combines executive education, certified programs, academic studies, and continuous hands-on experimentation. A key milestone was completing Competing in the Age of AI at Harvard Business School, which fundamentally shaped how I understand AI not as a standalone technology, but as a strategic force that reshapes operating models, leadership, and competitive advantage. The program helped me connect AI capabilities with organizational design, decision-making, and long-term value creation.\n\nIn parallel, I developed practical AI skills through programs such as Umiejętności Jutra, organized by Google in partnership with SGH, which focused on real-world applications of AI tools, productivity enhancement, and responsible adoption of emerging technologies in business contexts. I also participated in the AIDEAS program organized by Politechnika Wrocławska, a hands-on initiative centered on applied AI competencies, interdisciplinary collaboration, and solving concrete business and societal challenges using AI. This experience strengthened my ability to bridge technical concepts with business needs and human factors.\n\nThese programs complement my formal academic background in Marketing and Management from the University of Zielona Góra and Environmental Management from the University of Warsaw, which trained me to think systemically, analytically, and responsibly. Together, this educational foundation allows me to approach AI pragmatically — understanding its limitations, ethical implications, and organizational impact — while still moving fast and delivering tangible results in complex, real-world environments."
